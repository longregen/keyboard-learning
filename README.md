I have a new https://www.zsa.io/moonlander and I want to create a special layout for it. Please help me creating a tool to customize the keyboard with a version of Dvorak that is optimized for that keyboard, and also has altgr-intl like special characters. I type in English and Spanish, but I also want to learn German and the US altgr-intl is the best keyboard I have used. I'd like to also have vi-like motions with the Alt behaviors. I generally just use the web browser, vim, tmux, and I would like to get the best of all these embedded into my keyboard. What do you think about this? Please give me a html js css all in one that I can use to try out, change things, and that I can also print to use as a reference.
